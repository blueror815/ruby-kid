    question: Why do items need prices if we just want to trade?
    answer: If you’d like to stick with trading, that’s great!  But for those times
      when you just have to have something and simply can’t wait, we also offer the
      option to buy and sell.

    question: How does buying and selling work?
    answer: Each item has an “Add to Cart” option. If you wish to buy something or
      agree to sell something, it becomes a parent-to-parent transaction.

    question: How else is my child’s safety ensured?
    answer: Children are only linked to peers within their own school. So, interactions
      are with kids they already know. In addition, we employ an array of methods
      to ensure a safe environment for our users, from sophisticated algorithmic filters
      that snag swear words to live people with years of online security experience
      using their eyes and their instincts.

    question: Who is in my child’s “circle”?
    answer: Any user who is a student at the same school and is in the same grade,
      a grade above and a grade below your child. So, if your child is in 3rd grade,
      he can trade with 2nd, 3rd and 4th graders.

    question: What if a child is being inappropriate?
    answer: You or your child can hit “Report” and the offensive item and/or conversation
      are immediately removed and the parent of the reported child is notified. You
      can also block a user by going to “Boundaries” on your parental dashboard. Your
      child will no longer see their items or be able to communicate.

    question: Is my child’s information secure?
    answer: We take your privacy very seriously.  We solely collect a child’s grade
      and school in order to connect them with classmates and curate a safe, familiar
      environment for them to talk and trade with only kids they know. In compliance
      with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, we will not actively use
      information provided by your child in third-party advertising, nor will we track
      such information for that purpose. We will not retain your child’s information
      on our servers for longer than it is necessary to fulfill the purpose for which
      it was provided.
